# Writing a Subtractive Synthesizer from First Principles

## Motivation

- I think real-time audio is neat!
- Haven't been able to work with low-level object-oriented programming languages much
- Implementing algorithm a good way of understanding it
  - (as I've learned from the homework)
- Aiming fairly realistic
  - I've learned my lesson from last semester

---

## Components

- LP-BLIT (done!)
- Sine wave
- Square wave
- Sawtooth wave
- Triangle wave

---

## What's been done so far?

- Implemented LP-BLIT in MATLAB
  - Improved version of BLIT
  - (more to say about LP-BLIT?)

---

## What's my roadmap for the rest of the semester?

- Reimplement LP-BLIT in C++?
  - Possibly a different language, depending on how I'm feeling
  - Will be done this week -- relatively straightforward
- Implement other waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
  - Each is a goal in and of itself
  - Will chip away at them over the next week or two
    - Again, first in MATLAB, then in C++
