# MUMT 307 Semester Project

## Project idea: Subtractive Synthesizer

-   Written from scratch in C++/Rust/Zig
-   Likely using BLIT as basis for synthesis

## Additive vs. Subtractive Synthesis

-   Additive synthesis is like what we\'ve done in MATLAB
    -   Take a simple signal and filter it to add stuff
-   Subtractive synthesis is like what we\'ve been doing in Max
    -   Take a harmonically rich model, filter it to remove stuff
-   Both models arrive at the desired waveform, through different
    directions

## Overall Roadmap

-   Reference implementation in MATLAB
    -   Use class notes as reference
-   Own implementation in chosen language
    -   Use STK impl as reference
-   Bonus: Use JUCE/similar to create working VST
