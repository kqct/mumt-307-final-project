# Writing a Subtractive Synthesizer from First Principles

## Motivation

- I think real-time audio is neat!
- I'd like to better understand the algorithms that go into synthesis
  - and the math behind them!
- Aiming fairly realistic

---

## Components

- LP-BLIT
- Sawtooth wave
- Square wave
- Triangle wave

---

## Product

- MATLAB implementation:
  - LP-BLIT, sawtooth, square, triangle
- C++ implementation
  - LP-BLIT
- A much better understanding of synthesis concepts
  - Not quite something I can show on screen

---

## Challenges

- Comprehension isn't easy!
  - I spent a good portion of my time working on this project drawing diagrams on paper and writing little notes to myself
  - There are still some concepts that I think I'm missing
- Implementation issues
  - There are a good couple of C++ implementations missing compared to MATLAB
  - Had a couple issues with the leaky integrator not behaving as expected leading to a lack of prototypes

---

## What's left?

- Expansion of original idea (sine waves?)
- Incorporation into larger product
  - Current library is very theoretical

---

## What did I learn?

- I suck at budgeting time
- I still don't quite understand convolution
- MATLAB is actually kind of fun!
  - I originally shied away from prototyping in the language, but it was really helpful
- Writing idiomatic code can help a lot
