* MUMT 307 Semester Project
** Implementation of Basic Wavetable/Delay Line/etc. in Rust? (too software focused?)
** something to do with AM/FM synthesis? (will we cover this?)
** a granular synthesizer in Max/C (scope?)
** avoiding MATLAB (this isn't a project)
** waveform synthesis? I saw a video on the NES sound chip (i know we said we're skipping this)
** reimplementing types of Fourier transforms (neat learning tool, weird project?)
